def coins(num_coins):
    """
    Given an infinite supply of dimes and pennies, find the different amounts of
    money that can be created with exactly `num_coins` coins.

    Input: Integer representing the number of coins
    Output: Set of integers representing the different amounts of money that can be created

    For example, when num_coins = 3, you can create:
    3 = penny + penny + penny
    12 = dime + penny + penny
    21 = dime + dime + penny
    30 = dime + dime + dime

    So only 10 and 1 cent coints available, sum up all different combinations of coins to get the total number of cents.
    >>> coins(0) == {0}
    True

    >>> coins(1) == {1, 10}
    True

    >>> coins(2) == {2, 11, 20}
    True

    >>> coins(3) == {3, 12, 21, 30}
    True

    >>> coins(11) == {65, 101, 38, 74, 11, 110, 47, 83, 20, 56, 92, 29}
    True

    Pseudocode: 
    1. Loop through all possible numbers of dimes (from 0 to num_coins)
    2. For each number of dimes, calculate how many pennies you have left
    3. Calculate the total value and add it to your set
