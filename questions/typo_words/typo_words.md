#Typo Words
You have a list of several thousands of words in no particular order called vocabulary. 
Write the method is_word that takes in an arbitrary string, if the string can be changed to a word in your vocabulary with a single character substitution. Return all the corrected words if there is one typo, return None if there are none. 

Explain the time and space complexity of your algorithm.


**Examples:**
```code
is_word("cats") => ['bats', 'eats', 'Mats', 'cass', 'cate']

```
