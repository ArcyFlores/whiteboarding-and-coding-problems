#Is Palindrome with Grammer

Definition Palindrome: A palindrome is an arbitrary string that is equal to its reverse. 


Given a string, return whether or not it forms a palindrome ignoring case and non-alphabetical characters.
Note: a palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same forwards and backwards.

Ex: Given the following strings...

"level", return true
"algorithm", return false
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama.", return true
