#Find the Battle Ship
Write the method find_ship that returns the x and y coordinates of a three unit size ship. You have access to a function called hit_ship that takes in a x and y coordinates and returns a bool if it hits a ship. You have access to the map's width and height variables. 


**Examples:**
```code
find_ship() #=> [[#, #], [#, #], [#, #]]
```
A [Battle Ship class and instance](https://github.com/chatasweetie/whiteboarding-and-coding-problems/blob/master/questions/find_battle_ship/solution/battleship.py) in python is available to test your code
